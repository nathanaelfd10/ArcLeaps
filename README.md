# ArcLeaps - LeAPS Data Archival Engine

ArcLeaps is a software specifically built for archiving data from Leaps (A campus' student portal). 
This software was built for to-be alumnis who are about to graduate and lose their student email (therefore all study modules inside Leaps). 

ArcLeaps mainly uses web scraping techniques to obtain data.
